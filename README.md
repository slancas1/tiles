# Tiles Game

**Authors:** Sophie Lancaster and Brianna Hoelting

This is a simple game that prompts the user to click on the designated tile in each board without 
clicking any of the surrounding tiles. We based this game on a [popular app]. There are different game play options that are presented 
to the player before the game starts. For more details about the game refer to the *report.txt* file. 

## How to Play

**The game works best when played locally but you will need to have XQuartz downloaded**

1. Clone the repository
2. Type make in the command line
3. Run the executable that is created: *playtiles*

## Still to Do

* Improve graphics

## Known Issues

* The player's game score that displays when the game ends does not count correctly
